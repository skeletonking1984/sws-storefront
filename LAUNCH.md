## Daily log
### 2026-09-07
- Baseline audit, checklist created, agents dispatched for catalog sync + storefront commit/deploy.

#### Catalog sync
- Mapped all 16 (top 15 + Soul Blade) Etsy listings to Shopify products. Mapping file: `data/etsy-shopify-map.json`.
- 8 matched to existing active Shopify products (updated title/price/description/images to match Etsy, no em dashes): Neon Animated Twitch Chat and Goal Widget, Neon Moon Glow Chat Widget, Cosmic Galaxy Chat Widget, Sakura Floral Chat Widget, Moon Cloud Donation Goal Widget, Love Skeleton Goal Widget, Cloudy Moon Overlay, Rabbit Goal Widget.
- 1 reactivated from an archived, zero-stock duplicate (no active version existed): Sakura Glassy Chat Widget.
- 7 had no Shopify product at all (mostly newer 2026 Etsy listings never imported) and were created new, ACTIVE, with Etsy images/price/description: Multistream Chat Widget, Animated Star Goal Widget (Celestial), Y2K Sticker Chat Widget, Animated Moon Jar Goal Widget, Saber Neon Chat Widget, Neon Animated Multistream Chat Widget, Demon Samurai (Soul Blade) Stream Overlay Pack.
- Set productType (Chat Widget / Goal Widget / Overlay Pack) and SEO title/meta description (<=60/<=155 chars) on all 16.
- Archived 5 confirmed zero-inventory duplicate products (kept the active/new one per Etsy listing). Never deleted anything.
- Added all 16 to "Top Widgets" collection and to "Chat Widget" or "Goal Widget" as appropriate; set Top Widgets to MANUAL sort in the LAUNCH.md revenue order (reorder queued as a Shopify background job).
- Inventory: all 16 products are purchasable (either untracked inventory on new/reactivated products, or existing positive stock on matched products).
- Could not verify: digital file delivery (order -> download) end to end - out of scope for a catalog-only pass, flagged for the "digital download delivery verified end to end" checklist item.
- Noted discrepancy: internal notes recorded Soul Blade at $29.99, but the live Etsy listing (4569882300) is currently priced at $15.99 - used the live Etsy price on Shopify.
- 3 listings (Animated Star Goal Widget, Multistream Chat Widget, Y2K Sticker/Moon Jar/Saber/Neon Multistream Chat Widgets) had no confident image/description match against similarly-themed existing Shopify products, so new products were created rather than risk mis-mapping a top-revenue item onto the wrong listing.

#### Storefront
- Reviewed uncommitted diff (header icon buttons, footer brand block, SocialLinks component, description normalizer). Build clean, lint has 15 pre-existing errors/5 warnings unrelated to this diff (unused vars, one unescaped entity, missing tsconfig.json), confirmed by diffing lint output against main before the changes.
- Commits: `56a1412` header icon buttons + footer brand block + SocialLinks; `c794396` description normalizer (app/lib/productDescription.js, scripts/normalize-descriptions.mjs) + CLAUDE.md quirk note.
- Preview deploy: https://01m1yc1q8nbcy2npcs27c2xh3e-fb73b5b73c40344d0d20.myshopify.dev (Oxygen preview auth-gated by default; needs `oxygen-auth-bypass-token` header to curl, token expires in ~2h from deploy time).
- Launch-readiness gaps found (prioritized):
  1. Every route ships the literal Hydrogen skeleton title (`Hydrogen | Home`, `Hydrogen | <product>`, etc, confirmed on homepage and a PDP) with zero branding. Files: `app/routes/_index.jsx`, `products.$handle.jsx`, `collections.$handle.jsx`, `collections.all.jsx`, `blogs.*.jsx`, `pages.$handle.jsx`, `cart.jsx`, `search.jsx`, `policies.$handle.jsx`.
  2. No `<meta name="description">` on any page (home or PDP checked, none anywhere in `app/routes/`). Same files as above.
  3. No Open Graph or Twitter Card tags anywhere in the app, no shared SEO helper exists at all (grepped for `og:`, `getSeoMeta`, found nothing). Same route files, needs a shared `seo.js` helper.
  4. No canonical `<link>` tag on any page, risk of duplicate-content indexing once DNS cuts over. Add to `app/root.jsx` or the SEO helper.
  5. No JSON-LD Product structured data on PDP (checked `sci-fi-neon-chat-widget-kick-twitch-obs`, no `application/ld+json` anywhere). `app/routes/products.$handle.jsx`.
  6. Favicon is still the default Hydrogen "H" mark, not SWS's holographic lighthouse logo. `app/assets/favicon.svg`.
  7. No og:image / social share image site-wide, links shared to X/Discord show no thumbnail. Needs a static OG image referenced from the SEO helper.
  - Not a code gap, just a note: Oxygen preview URLs are auth-gated by default (Shopify OAuth redirect), expected preview behavior, not present on production/custom domains.
  - robots.txt and sitemap.xml are correct and self-referencing the current host already (no myshopify.com hardcoding found anywhere in `app/`), no action needed there.

#### Blockers found 2026-09-07 (need Todd)
- **Digital delivery**: Shopify Digital Products app IS installed (first-party, not visible via appInstallations API; no public API, files attach manually in Admin). 8 of the 16 top products created/reactivated today have no asset: Multistream Chat (PastelMultistreamchat.zip), Star Goal (streamelements.zip, StarGoalWidgetStreamlabs.zip, 2 PDFs), Y2K Sticker (Y2KMultiChatCode.zip + PDF), Moon Jar (MoontipjarFixedStreamelements.zip), Saber Neon (NeonChatandGoalCodefile.zip + PDF), Neon Multistream (MultistreamChatWidget-Final.zip + PDF), Soul Blade (SoulBladeOverlayPack.zip), Sakura Glassy (SakuraGlassyChatWidget.zip + PDF). Todd/Auny upload from Etsy listing manager.
- Soul Blade Etsy price is 15.99 live (memory said 29.99). Shopify set to 15.99 to match. Confirm intended price.
- Create discount code WELCOME10 for the homepage email capture.
